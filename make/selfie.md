## Reflection
When I look at the first AI-generated selfie, I recognize myself in the surface-level details: my glasses, long hair, and the calm, composed expression. These features reflect how I often present myself in photos and how others might easily identify me. The image feels familiar in a visual sense, capturing a clean and socially acceptable version of me that aligns with common expectations of a “selfie.” In this way, the AI successfully reproduces my outward appearance and reduces my identity to recognizable traits.
However, I do not fully see myself beyond this surface. The image feels flattened and overly polished, as if complexity has been smoothed away. My personality, emotions, and lived experiences are missing. There is no trace of uncertainty, depth, or contradiction—qualities that are central to how I understand myself. The AI presents a version of me that feels generic, as though it could easily belong to someone else with similar features. This absence highlights how AI systems prioritize visual patterns over inner identity.
The second image exaggerates this distance even more. Through distortion and heavy stylization, my face becomes less human and more illustrative, almost symbolic. While I intentionally intervened to disrupt realism, the result emphasizes how easily my identity can be transformed into something aesthetic rather than personal. In this version, I see myself less as an individual and more as data being reshaped. Together, the images reveal how AI can represent me visually while simultaneously erasing the complexity that makes me who I am.

## Attribution & AI Use
- Tools used: Stable Diffusion(via web interface), Github, Visual Studio Code.
- AI prompts (summary): I uploaded a real photo of myself and prompted the AI to generate a stylized selfie based on my facial features, glasses, and overall appearance. For the second image, I prompted the AI to exaggerate colors, lines, and textures to create a more distorted and graphic version.
- What AI generated: The AI generated both selfie images, including facial structure, coloring, and stylistic effects.
- What you changed or decided: I chose the original photo, selected and refined the prompts, and decided how the second image would be distorted to emphasize stylization and loss of realism. I also selected which images to include and how to frame them within the assignment.
